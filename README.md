# scitos_metralabs

ROS packages for the MetraLabs Scitos G5 mobile robot.


## branch information

* master: used until groovy
* hydro-devel: used since hydro
* modded_amtec_library: special branch with specific, local changes

The current official branch (atm. hydro-devel) and modded_amtec_library should both stay consistent except for those specific things. But as development will take place in the latter the official one might not be up to date.
